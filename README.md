# Automated Cardiac Disease Diagnosis Using Convolutional Neural Networks And Linear Regression For Ecg Signal Classification
  This project aims to classify ECG signals and detect cardiac diseases using a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Linear Regression. It processes ECG image data, extracts meaningful features, and provides accurate predictions to assist in early cardiac diagnosis. Deployed with Streamlit for user-friendly interaction.
